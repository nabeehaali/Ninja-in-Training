# 🐱‍👤 Ninja-in-Training

This is a 2D mini-game about becoming a master ninja. The player must be able to dodge incoming shurikens while being able to move faster over time as they advance from one skill level to the next. 

*This project was completed for IMD4006 Advanced Game Design & Development, where the only constraint was that the player was only required to use the 'X' key to perform any action.*
